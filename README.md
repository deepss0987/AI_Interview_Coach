About the Project 
The AI-Powered Interview Coaching Platform is designed to help job seekers improve their interview performance through intelligent, automated feedback. Instead of practicing interviews alone with no guidance, users can now receive real-time, data-driven insights on their answers — just like having a personal interview coach available 24/7.
The platform analyzes responses based on:

Tone — Is the answer confident and professional?
Keyword Relevance — Does the answer include the right industry-specific terms?
Answer Quality — Is the response structured and complete?
